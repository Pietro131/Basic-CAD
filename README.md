<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> For me once I got into the mindset and got the hang of it, it wasn't so hard. Some mistakes to avoid for next time would be to not open so many sketches, and then remove the sketches that I'm not using, because at some points it was very cluttered, and it was hard to do good work. Something that I want to try for next time will be to see if I can name the sketches (and "Extrude's) because that will make organization and my life much easier. </p>
