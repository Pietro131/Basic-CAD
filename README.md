## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

Following along with the video made the assignment considerably easier. I would go, watch him perform a step, pause the video and do the step myself. My only worry is if I become to over dependent on his videos. I suppose we'll find out when we start doing independent projects. Once I got the hang of what we were doing it was a breeze, but before I got the hang of it it was tricky, and frustrating. 

Adding an image to my GitHub was very frustrating but with the help of Mr. Dierolf I got it done.

## Mount

### Description

I built a square with the sides being 120 mm. Then on each corner of the square I added a circle that was 20mm from the top and from the side of the square. The circumference of the circle was 10 mm. Then I added a centerpoint circle in the center of the square that was 20 mm in circumference.

### Reflection

This one was pretty easy and I finished it really quickly compared to "The Base." That may just be because "The Base" was the first one I did so I had less experience.

## Fork

### Description

Of all the ones we've done so far this one is definetly the hardest. We built something that kinda looks like the plug for an electrical device. It has a circular base, with two tongs coming out of one end. The tongs have circles on the end of them. On the other side of the circular base is a hollow cylender coming out of it.

### Reflection

Even though this was the hardest/most complicated one we've had to do so far, I managed to do it the quickest. I've begun to memorize some of the keyboard shortcuts, I've had to pause the videos less, and I can build the shapes quicker.

## Tire

### Description

For this we made a tire, similar to one you would see on a bike.

### Reflection

This one seemed pretty tricky but not much new was introduced so I could do it pretty easily.

## Wheel and Bearings

### Description

This is a wheel with five spokes, it does not include the tire. Later one I added bearings to the wheel

### Reflection

The wheel was the hardest one I've done yet, but the bearings were pretty easy.
