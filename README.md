## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

Following along with the video made the assignment considerably easier. I would go, watch him perform a step, pause the video and do the step myself. My only worry is if I become to over dependent on his videos. I suppose we'll find out when we start doing independent projects. Once I got the hang of what we were doing it was a breeze, but before I got the hang of it it was tricky, and frustrating. 

Adding an image to my GitHub was very frustrating but with the help of Mr. Dierolf I got it done.
