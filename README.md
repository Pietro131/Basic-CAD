## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

Following along with the video made the assignment considerably easier. I would go, watch him perform a step, pause the video and do the step myself. My only worry is if I become to over dependent on his videos. I suppose we'll find out when we start doing independent projects. Once I got the hang of what we were doing it was a breeze, but before I got the hang of it it was tricky, and frustrating. 

Adding an image to my GitHub was very frustrating but with the help of Mr. Dierolf I got it done.

## Mount

### Description

I built a square with the sides being 120 mm. Then on each corner of the square I added a circle that was 20mm from the top and from the side of the square. The circumference of the circle was 10 mm. Then I added a centerpoint circle in the center of the square that was 20 mm in circumference.

### Reflection
This one was pretty easy and I finished it really quickly compared to "The Base." That may just be because "The Base" was the first one I did so I had less experience.
